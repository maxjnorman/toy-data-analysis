When deleting uploaded files, need to add functionality to delete files
from the media/documents folder as app only deletes them from the database.

need to use --> os.remove(os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, self.docfile.name))
Also, maybe best to add these functions to the upload model itself?


Seems pretty simple to add a confirmation popup using javascript.
